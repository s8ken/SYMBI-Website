# 🔧 Frontegg Setup Fix Guide

## 🎯 Issue Identified

Your Frontegg domain `app-vs8b106vhrxc.frontegg.com` is partially working:
- ✅ **Hosted Login Page**: Working (returns 200)
- ❌ **JWKS Endpoint**: Returns HTML login page instead of JSON

This indicates your Frontegg environment needs proper configuration.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Access Your Frontegg Portal
1. Go to https://frontegg.com
2. Log in with your account
3. Navigate to your environment dashboard

### Step 2: Verify Environment Status
1. **Check Environment**: Ensure you're in the correct environment
2. **Environment Status**: Look for any "Draft" or "Unpublished" indicators
3. **If Draft**: Click "Publish" to make changes live

### Step 3: Configure Application Settings
1. **Go to**: `Applications` tab
2. **Check**: You have at least one application listed
3. **Verify**: Application status is "Active"
4. **If Multiple Apps**: Set one as default

### Step 4: Enable and Configure Hosted Login
1. **Navigate to**: `Authentication` → `Login Method`
2. **Hosted Login Section**:
   - ✅ Ensure "Hosted Login" is **ENABLED**
   - ✅ Check "Allow Signups" if needed
   - ✅ Verify redirect URLs include your local development URL

### Step 5: Publish Your Configuration
1. **Go to**: `Builder` → `Login Box`
2. **Customize**: Set up your branding (optional)
3. **Important**: Click `Review` → `Publish` to make changes live

### Step 6: Verify Domain and Keys
1. **Go to**: `Keys & Domains`
2. **Copy exact values**:
   - Frontegg Domain
   - Client ID
   - API Key
3. **Update your `.env.local`** with exact values

## 🧪 Test Your Fix

After completing the steps above, run these commands:

```bash
# Test the JWKS endpoint directly
curl -s https://app-vs8b106vhrxc.frontegg.com/oauth/jwks | head -5

# Should return JSON like: {"keys":[{"kty":"RSA",...}]}
# NOT HTML like: <!DOCTYPE html>
```

```bash
# Run our diagnosis tool
node scripts/diagnose-frontegg.js
```

```bash
# Run full setup test
node scripts/test-setup.js
```

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- JWKS endpoint returns JSON with `{"keys":[...]}`
- Hosted login page loads without errors
- No "Draft" status in Frontegg portal
- Application shows as "Active"

### ❌ Still Having Issues?

**If JWKS still returns HTML:**
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** after publishing (propagation delay)
2. **Clear browser cache** and try again
3. **Check application configuration** - ensure it's properly set up
4. **Verify environment** - make sure you're in the right one

**If hosted login doesn't work:**
1. Check redirect URLs in Frontegg portal
2. Ensure `http://localhost:3000` is in allowed origins
3. Verify hosted login is enabled

## 🎯 Quick Verification Checklist

## 🆘 Still Stuck?
